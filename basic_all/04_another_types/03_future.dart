  // ----------------------------------------------

  // !Future
  // In dart, the Future represents a value or error that is not yet available. It is used to represent a potential value, or error, that will be available at some time in the future.

  //  Future represents the result of an asynchronous operation and can have 2 states.
  //  - uncompleted: When you call an asynchronous function, it returns to an uncompleted future. It means the future is waiting for the function asynchronous operation to finish or to throw an error.
  //  - completed: It can be completed with value or completed with error. Future<int> produces an int value, and Future<String> produces a String value. If the future doesnâ€™t produce any value, then the type of future is Future<void>

  // If the asynchronous operation performed by the function fails due to any reason, the future completes with an error.

  // You can create a future in dart by using Future class.
  // You can also create a future by using Future.value() method.
  // You can use future in dart by using then() method.
