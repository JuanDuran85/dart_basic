/* 
 Difference Between Extends & Implements

 extends:
    Used to inherit a class in another class. 	
    Gives complete method definition to sub-class.
    Only one class can be extended.
    It is optional to override the methods.
    Constructors of the superclass is called before the sub-class constructor. 	
    The super keyword is used to access the members of the superclass. 	
    Sub-class need not to override the fields of the superclass. 	

Implements:
    Used to inherit a class as an interface in another class.
    Gives abstract method definition to sub-class.
    Multiple classes can be implemented.
    Concrete class must override the methods of an interface.
    Constructors of the superclass is not called before the sub-class constructor.
    Interface members canâ€™t be accessed using the super keyword.
    Subclass must override the fields of the interface.
